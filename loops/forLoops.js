/*
-Loops  offer us a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly , or loop over
something. 
-There are many kinds of loops, but they all roughly do the same thing.
    -it will repeat until a specified condition evaluates to true
        -for statement
        -do while statement
        -while statement
        -labeled statement
        -break statement
        -for in statement
        -for of statement

        Note: there is a danger of infinite loops. There are threee main parts to a loop. :
             -initial exopression
             -condition
             -increment expression
